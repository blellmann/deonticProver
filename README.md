# deonticProver

deonticProver is a prototype implementation of proof search in a weak
deontic logic under global assumptions. The global assumptions are
rendered consistent using the specificity principle, stating that more
specific obligations overrule less specific ones.

The prover is based on the article "Resolving conflicting obligations
in Mimamsa: A sequent-based approach" (published in the proceedings of
DEON 2018), see also

For details on usage, see the file readme.txt.
